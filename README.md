* [Java Utility Library](https://github.com/JonathanxD/JwIUtils) [Java]

### 🌱 Programming Languages I know (ordered by years of continuously using and studying it)

I understand the important concepts behind different programming languages, from pure functional to multiparadigm ones. I'm very comfortable to work with any language, even those I've never touched.

Programming languages are just tools, you chose what best fits your needs, and you should never be afraid of using a different tool to get the work done.

* Java (7 years)
* Kotlin (5 years)
* Rust, Scala, Groovy (3 years)
* Javascript, Lua (2 years)
* Kotlin/Native, Go, Pawn, Golo, Gosu, Ceylon (1 year)
* PHP, Delphi, Visual Basic, C#, C/C++, Python, Perl (< 1 year)
* Nim, Clojure, Haskell (some months to get interesting concepts)

### 🪛 Main Frameworks, Tools, Databases and SOs

I've been using a bunch of tools in my daily work and personal projects, I understand them very well and use the best one to solve the problem, sometimes I combine them to have different visualizations and results, which helps me find out the best approach to solve problems.

#### Frameworks
* Spring
* Ktor
* Coroutines
* Micrometer
* RxJava1/2, Reactive Core
* JUnit, Mockito and Kotest
* ByteBuddy

#### Tools/Languages
* Java, Kotlin and Rust
* VisualVM/JConsole
* Docker
* Git
* Gradle, Maven
* IntelliJ IDEA
* JetBrains Space and TeamCity
* Grafana

#### Databases
* SQL: MySQL, Postgresql
* NoSQL: MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch
* NoSQL: InfluxDB, Cassandra
* Hybrid: BigQuery

#### Operational Systems
* Windows
* Windows Server
* Linux (Debian-based, RPM-based, and independent ones)
* macOS
* FreeBSD

### 🧰 Frameworks and Concepts I know (others than I used in my work)

I'm not afraid of change, I keep studying different frameworks, concepts and languages. Technology is constantly changing, we need to change as well.

* Java EE (now Jakarta EE)
* Dependency Injection (Guice, Koin)
* Collections (Google Guava and Fastutil)
* Serialization (Jackson/Gson/Kotlinx Serialization)
* Circuit Breaker (Resilience4J)
* Message Broker (Kafka and RabbitMQ)
* Event Driven Development ([EventSys](https://github.com/KoresFramework/EventSys))
* Concurrent, Async and Parallel Programming (Java 8 Streams, CompletableFuture, Thread Pool, Coroutines, Event Loop/Reactive Stack)
* Functional Programming (Java 8 Lambda, Scala, Kotlin and Haskell)
* Immutability (Immutable Data Structures)
* High Availability (Netflix Stack and Spring Cloud Stack)
* Serverless (Ktor and Spring)
* Sampling, Profiling and Monitoring (VisualVM, Micrometer, InfluxDB, Grafana and Prometheus)
* Deadlock Analysis using Thread Dump
* Memory Leak Analysis using VisualVM
* Performance improvement (find the problem, calculate the time complexity, architect a solution and apply the new algorithm with a better time complexity)
* Software Planning and Architecture

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I've started developing software in 2010, when I had only 10 years and no Internet connection. I always liked computers and did fixed computers for friends and neighbors, and got money by doing that, and with this money I went to lan house to download all I need to develop. I know how to setup networks, firewalls, Windows Server, find and replace fault components, and started using Linux in 2014. Later on, I did professionalizing TI course, and I impressed the teacher and other students, by being so young and knowing so much.

I like to jump into things outside of coding world, and try to understand them very well. I've created my own Kubernetes Cluster, deployed the services automatically through a CI/CD pipeline and exposed those services to the web in a HTTPS domain, configured with Nginx and Let's Encrypt. I never been afraid of failing, we need to be able to handle the failure in order to be able to handle the success.

I even created my own compiler, which translates Abstract Syntax Tree into JVM Bytecode. This was the most challenging project I ever made in my life, I learned about Stack, Heap, Garbage Collection, and bunch of things about JVM Internals, such as Lookup Switch, Table Switch, Stack VM, Register VM. This served as the base to start to write my own language and to understand how things worked under-the-hood and how to improve the performance of the code.
